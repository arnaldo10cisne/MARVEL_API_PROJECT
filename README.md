## Get all the information you want about the Marvel Universe!

With this application, you'll be able to fetch data directly from the [MARVEL API](https://developer.marvel.com/), to obtain information releated to marvel characters, comics, series, events, stories and creators.

You start by finding a Marvel Character. Then, from that character, you can find its comics, and then you can find the series any comic belongs to, and then the event any series took place in, and then the creator of that event. That is just one route, but you can go any route you want.

The Marvel API has the following features:

-   Has a limitation of 20 results per request. Even if a character has appeared on hundreds of comics since its creation, the API is only going to show the first 20 results in alphabetical order.
-   Has a limitation of 3000 requests per day. If the website is not returning any value, consider the option of trying again in 24 hours.
-   To access the API, the use of a private and public key is required. By default, the website is already using my own private and public keys.
